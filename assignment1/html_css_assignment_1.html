      This article is about the worldwide computer network. For other uses, see

      The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks
      that use the standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several
      billion devices worldwide. It is a <span>network of networks</span> that
      consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and
      government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of
      electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet
      carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as
      the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide
      Web(WWW), the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks
      for file sharing and telephony.

      The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the
      United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant
      communication via computer networks.[2] This work, combined with work in
      the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor network, the
      ARPANET, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to "the ARPA internet".

        The interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the
        beginning of the transition to the modern Internet.
      </span>
      From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained exponential growth
      as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were
      connected to it.
